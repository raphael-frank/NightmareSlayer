# Nightmare Slayer
<h3>Itch.io Page: https://knifeuine.itch.io/nightmare-slayerÂ </h3>

Nightmare Slayer was created during the GameDevWeek in Trier (March 2023). It is a Metroidvania and is inspired by games like Hollow Knight. You can dynamically switch between the normal and the nightmare world, in which you have different abilities, but the enemies are also more difficult.

It was developed in one week with the Unity Engine by six people. I was involved as a software engineer and game designer, programming the player controller as well as many enemies and the game logic.
